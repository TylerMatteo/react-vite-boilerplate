# React Vite Boilerplate

This is a simple React boilerplate created from the Vite `react-ts` [template](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

## Code quality tooling
* [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting
* [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting
* [tsc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for type checking
* [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky) for easy git hooks
* [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged) for running git hooks on staged changes

## Using this template repo
Once you have [made your new repo from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template), you can get started creating your React application. Here are some tips to get started:
* Delete the contents of this README and replace it with some interesting details about your project!
* Update values in `package.json` to reflect your new project. Updating the `name` field is especially important.
* You will likely want to remove placeholder code in `/src/App.tsx`. Please note that the files added to Vite's default assets and public folder, `/src/assets/react.svg` and `/public/vite.svg` respectively, have been left in this template deliberately so that their respective folders do not become empty and therefore untracked by git.
